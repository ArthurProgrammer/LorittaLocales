My objective is to make your server more üëåüî•üîù with more entertainment, better administration and with stuff that you *never* seen in other bots!\n\nWell... Enough blabbing about nothing! Let me talk about some stuff that maybe you will like. üòâ\n\n‚Ä¢ By default my prefix is `+`, try using `+ping` in your server to be sure that I''m working!\n‚Ä¢ If you want to change/enable/disable my features, then go to my panel! {2}\n‚Ä¢ If you need help, if you want to report bugs, if you want to suggest something or if you just want to talk about me, why not visit my apartament? üòä {3}\n‚Ä¢ I have a bunch of commands (If you wanna know, I have **{4} different commands**!), if you want to know every single one of them, use *help* in this chat!\n‚Ä¢ You can send new YouTube videos of an YouTube channel directly on your server! (Also... did you know that I do notify new videos faster than YouTube itself? üòâ) Just go to my panel and configure that!\n\n...seriously, my panel has everything and a bit more, go check it out! {2}\n\n**Tip from <:loritta:331179879582269451>, the brunette of the neighborhood:** If you have a bit of money laying around, then please donate! <{5}> Did you know it costs 260R$ per month to keep me online?
